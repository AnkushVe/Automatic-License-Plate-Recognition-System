Object Detection Using Deep Learning

Tech Stack : PyTorch, Python, YOLO, Object Detection, Computer Vision

1. Dataset: Utilized a pre-annotated dataset consisting of 433 images.
2. Data Processing: Extensively processed XML files and converted annotations into YOLO format.
3. Model Training: Trained a YOLOv8 model for 100 epochs.
4. Performance Metrics: Achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.7 at loU=0.5 and 0.5 at
IoU=0.5:0.95.
5. Deployment: Successfully deployed the trained model using Streamlit for real-time license plate detection.
